These converted industrial buildings were built into luxury loft apartments over the last 5 or so years. How do you feel about exposed brick? I hope you love it because it's all over the place, giving these apartments the warm, unique feel only they can deliver. Everything is super easy here too, and it's only first month and a one month's security deposit to move in. High efficiency laundry machines are in the unit, no need to drag all of your clothes to a laundromat anymore. This is a great place for entertaining, with the open kitchen and high ceilinged living room. Speaking of kitchen, granite counters and LED underlighting are all over the place, and the breakfast bar is great for stay at home date nights. Wake up to the rising sun through your HUGE insulated windows, which let in all of the warm sunlight and none of the sounds of the city. When you're done oogling over the apartment itself, there's a brand new Whole Foods up the street, and you can hop on the T at the Broadway Street Station to get downtown to explore.Give me a call if you love this apartment as much as I do!
